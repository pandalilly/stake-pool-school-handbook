# Configure a Linux server on AWS

If you do not have access to a computer running Linux \(or VirtualBox\), you can use Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) to create a cloud-based virtual machine running Linux for free. To do so, please follow the steps below:

* Go to [Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create a \(free\) account if you do not have one already.
* Go to the _AWS Management Console_.
* Go to the _EC2 Dashboard_.

* If you already have a running instance, go to step 9.
* We must first make sure to get enough harddrive space \(at least 24GB\). Click on _Volumes_.

* Under _Actions_, select _Modify Volume_.

* In the _Modify Volume_ dialog, select a size of 24 and click _Modify_, then confirm in the next dialog.

* As Instance Type, choose _t2.medium_, then click _Review and Launch_ and finally _Launch_ on the next screen.
