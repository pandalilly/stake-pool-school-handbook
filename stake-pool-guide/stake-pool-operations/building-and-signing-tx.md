# Building and signing transactions

Transactions vary in complexity, depending on their intended outcomes, but all transactions share a number of attributes:

* Input - contains funds that are spent by the transaction. It is simply the output of an earlier transaction. A transaction can have multiple inputs.
* Output - determine where the funds go to. An output is given by a payment address and an amount. A transaction can have multiple outputs.
* Payment address - an address that can receive payments, This is the only type of addresses that can be specified in a transaction output.
* Payment and stake key pairs - sets of files containing a public verification key and a private signing key.
* Time-to-live \(TTL\) - represents a slot, or deadline by which a transaction must be submitted. The TTL is an absolute slot number, rather than a relative one, which means that the --ttl value should be greater than the current slot number. A transaction becomes invalid once its ttl expires.

When building and submitting a transaction you need to check the current tip of the blockchain, for example, if the tip is slot 4000, and you want to submit a transaction to send some ADA, you should set the TTL to 4100, so that you have enough time to build and submit a transaction. Submitting a transaction with a TTL set in the past would result in a tx submission error.

**Building a raw transaction**

Before submitting a transaction, it must be built. Create a raw file that contains all relevant data for the transaction:

```text
cardano-cli shelley transaction build-raw \

--tx-in TX-IN            The input transaction as TxId#TxIx where TxId is the
                         transaction hash and TxIx is the index.
--tx-out TX-OUT          The ouput transaction as Address+Lovelace where
                         Address is the Bech32-encoded address followed by the
                         amount in Lovelace.
--ttl SLOT               Time to live (in slots).
--fee LOVELACE           The fee amount in Lovelace.
--certificate-file FILE  Filepath of the certificate. This encompasses all
                         types of certificates (stake pool certificates, stake
                         key certificates etc)
--withdrawal WITHDRAWAL  The reward withdrawal as StakeAddress+Lovelace where
                         StakeAddress is the Bech32-encoded stake address
                         followed by the amount in Lovelace.
--metadata-json-file FILE
                         Filepath of the metadata file, in JSON format.
--metadata-cbor-file FILE
                         Filepath of the metadata, in raw CBOR format.
--update-proposal-file FILE
                         Filepath of the update proposal.
--out-file FILE          Output filepath of the TxBody.
```

**Fee calculation**

Every transaction on the blockchain carries a fee, which needs to be calculated each time. This fee calculation requires protocol parameters.

```text
cardano-cli shelley query protocol-parameters \

--shelley-mode           For talking to a node running in Shelley-only mode
                         (default).
--byron-mode             For talking to a node running in Byron-only mode.
--epoch-slots NATURAL    The number of slots per epoch (default is 21600).
--security-param NATURAL The security parameter (default is 2160).
--cardano-mode           For talking to a node running in full Cardano mode.
--epoch-slots NATURAL    The number of slots per epoch (default is 21600).
--security-param NATURAL The security parameter (default is 2160).
--mainnet                Use the mainnet magic id.
--testnet-magic NATURAL  Specify a testnet magic id.
--out-file FILE          Optional output file. Default is to write to stdout.
```

```text
cardano-cli shelley transaction calculate-min-fee \

  --tx-body-file FILE      Input filepath of the TxBody.
  --mainnet                Use the mainnet magic id.
  --testnet-magic NATURAL  Specify a testnet magic id.
  --protocol-params-file FILE
                           Filepath of the JSON-encoded protocol parameters file
  --tx-in-count NATURAL    The number of transaction inputs.
  --tx-out-count NATURAL   The number of transaction outputs.
  --witness-count NATURAL  The number of Shelley key witnesses.
  --byron-witness-count NATURAL
                           The number of Byron key witnesses.
```

**Signing a transaction**

A transaction must prove that it has the right to spend its inputs. In the most common case, this means that a transaction must be signed by the signing keys belonging to the payment addresses of the inputs. If a transaction contains certificates, it must additionally be signed by somebody with the right to issue those certificates. For example, a stake address registration certificate must be signed by the signing key of the corresponding stake key pair.

```text
cardano-cli shelley transaction sign \
--tx-body-file FILE      Input filepath of the TxBody.
--signing-key-file FILE  Input filepath of the signing key (one or more).
--mainnet                Use the mainnet magic id.
--testnet-magic NATURAL  Specify a testnet magic id.
--out-file FILE          Output filepath of the Tx.
```

**Submit a transaction**

Submitting a transaction means sending the signed transaction through the local node whose Unix domain socket is obtained from the CARDANO\_NODE\_SOCKET\_PATH enviromnent variable.

```text
cardano-cli shelley transaction submit

--shelley-mode           For talking to a node running in Shelley-only mode
                         (default).
--byron-mode             For talking to a node running in Byron-only mode.
--epoch-slots NATURAL    The number of slots per epoch (default is 21600).
--security-param NATURAL The security parameter (default is 2160).
--cardano-mode           For talking to a node running in full Cardano mode.
--epoch-slots NATURAL    The number of slots per epoch (default is 21600).
--security-param NATURAL The security parameter (default is 2160).
--mainnet                Use the mainnet magic id.
--testnet-magic NATURAL  Specify a testnet magic id.
--tx-file FILE           Filepath of the transaction you intend to submit.
